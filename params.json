In this course we will discover what robots are, learn how to design them, and use simple tools to build them. Students will use open source hardware to explore sensors and electronics, as well as design and build robot bodies and actuators through a variety of digital fabrication technologies. Using a set of community developed tools, students will become familiar with concepts such as mechatronics, inverse kinematics, domotics and machine learning. No previous programming or electronics experience is necessary, however students will be guided through a series of design challenges that their robots should be able to accomplish. With an emphasis on experimentation, peer learning, and team work, the objective of this course is to share in the excitement of robotics by enabling students to make their own creations.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Program:</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Week 1: </b>Robots definitions.

Design presentation. Peer review of designs.</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Exhibition</strong>: Robot creations</span></p>\r\n<strong>Grading</strong>\r\n\r\nGrades will be determined based on the following breakdown:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>30% Attendance and Participation</li>\r\n\t<li>30% Assignments, including required documentation ( at least one picture or video, one brief explanation of what was intended to test and what was actually learnt )</li>\r\n\t<li>40% Final challenge setup and presentation</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Classroom Conduct</strong>\r\n\r\nClasses begin promptly at the scheduled start time. Please arrive early so as not to be late. This class will be highly participatory with lectures being very conversational. You are invited and expected to contribute to in-class discussions.\r\n\r\nRecreational use of phones, music payers, video game systems and other portable electronic devices is forbidden. Laptops are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational browsing of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.\r\n\r\n<strong>Learning Objectives</strong>\r\n\r\nAt the completion of this course students will be able to demonstrate basic understanding of:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>what is a robot, how are they being used and which applications can they have</li>\r\n\t<li>robot design, including electronics, software and mechatronics</li>\r\n\t<li>difficulties and obstacles to overcome when assembling a a technical project</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<strong>Attendance &amp; Participation</strong>\r\n\r\nAttendance in all class sessions is mandatory. Unexcused absences or lateness will adversely affect your grade. NYU policy does permit members of any religious group to absent themselves from classes without penalty when required for compliance with their religious obligations. If you are going to miss a class, it is your responsibility to make up the material you miss. Please let the instructor know ahead of time so that he/she can help you determine how to make up the material.\r\n\r\nYour participation in this class is essential. Not only does it allow the instructor to gauge your interests and get to know you as an individual, but it also allows the instructor to asses your understanding of important concepts. It also provides the instructor with an opportunity to learn from your work. As a result, attendance and participation make up a meaningful percentage of your grade. Unexcused absence in more than three classes and / or labs will result in a failing grade.\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Bibliography:</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Make an Arduino-Controlled Robot</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><img class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSl9MGRIozfY-fbhAawOsKZWiJvZ9RfNzVUIpnx0DXRkRPcLqDj\" alt=\"\" width=\"886\" height=\"1080\" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Autonomous and Remote-Controlled Bots on Wheels</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\">By <a href=\"http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028024.do#tab_04_2\"><span class=\"s3\">Michael Margolis</span></a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Publisher: Maker Media, Inc</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Final Release Date: October 2012</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Pages: 256</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Paperback edition:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"http://www.amazon.cn/Make-an-Arduino-controlled-Robot-Margolis-Michael/dp/1449344372/\">http://www.amazon.cn/Make-an-Arduino-controlled-Robot-Margolis-Michael/dp/1449344372/</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Online version:</span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/make-an-arduino-controlled/9781449344368/\">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/make-an-arduino-controlled/9781449344368/</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Optional media materials:</b></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/arduino-robot-bonanza/9780071782777/\">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/arduino-robot-bonanza/9780071782777/</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/arduino-robotics/9781430231837/\">https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/arduino-robotics/9781430231837/</a></span></p>\r\n<p class=\"p5\"><span class=\"s4\"><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/nanomouse/\">https://www.udemy.com/nanomouse/</a></span></p>",
