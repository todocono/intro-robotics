<p><b>Description:</b></p>

<p>Since the beginning of civilization people have fantasized about intelligent machines sensing and acting autonomously. In this course we will discover what robots are, learn how to design them, and use simple tools to build them. Students will use open source hardware to explore sensors and electronics, as well as design and build robot bodies and actuators through a variety of digital fabrication technologies. Using a set of community developed tools, students will become familiar with concepts such as mechatronics, inverse kinematics, domotics and machine learning. No previous programming or electronics experience is necessary, however students will be guided through a series of design challenges that their robots should be able to accomplish. With an emphasis on experimentation, peer learning, and team work, the objective of this course is to share in the excitement of robotics by enabling students to make their own creations.</p>

<p><b>Program:</b></p>

<p><b>Week 1: </b>Robots definitions. Electrical Parameters. Sensors &amp; Actuators. Software, Hardware and Firmware. DC Motors and drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> create an obstacle avoider vehicle with a basic sensor. Description of what are robots and what not.</p>

<p><b>Week 2: </b>Analog/Digital Conversion. PWM and H bridges. Sensor clasifications and detailed usage of light sensors</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> make a robot follow a light or follow a line. What sensors should an autonomous robot teacher have?</p>

<p><b>Week 3</b>: Ultrasound sensors. Mechatronics and degrees of freedom. Feedback loops. Filters. P.I.D. Servomotors. Grippers. Software documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: make a delta robot. Document it's software.</p>

<p><b>Week 4: </b>Mechanical construction techniques. Laser cutting. 3D printing. Center of mass. Stability. Sketching. Robot classifications. Design principles applied to Robotics.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: create an unique structure. Design presentation, including case scenario.</p>

<p><b>Week 5: </b>Orthogonal &amp; polar coordinates. Change of coordinates. Inverse kinematics. Telecommunication. Finite states machines.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables</strong>: make first proof of concept for the project. Detailed diagrams of it's finite state machine.</p>

<p><b>Week 6:</b> Artificial Intelligence. Machine Learning. Cloud connected Robotics. Domotics. Social robotics.</p>

<p><strong>Deliverables:</strong> Robots check-point</p>

<p><b>Week 7: </b>Final challenge setup. Design presentation. Peer review of designs.</p>

<p><strong>Exhibition</strong>: Robot creations</p>

<p><strong>Grading</strong></p>

<p>Grades will be determined based on the following breakdown:</p>

<ul>
    <li>30% Attendance and Participation</li>
    <li>30% Assignments, including required documentation ( at least one picture or video, one brief explanation of what was intended to test and what was actually learnt )</li>
    <li>40% Final challenge setup and presentation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Classroom Conduct</strong></p>

<p>Classes begin promptly at the scheduled start time. Please arrive early so as not to be late. This class will be highly participatory with lectures being very conversational. You are invited and expected to contribute to in-class discussions.</p>

<p>Recreational use of phones, music payers, video game systems and other portable electronic devices is forbidden. Laptops are allowed for note taking, in class work, as well as relevant research only. Activities not related to the class, such as recreational browsing of the internet, including all social media websites, email and instant messaging, game playing, and work for other classes, will not be permitted. Such activities are disrespectful to the instructor and distracting to others. Your laptop should always be closed whenever a fellow student is presenting.</p>

<p><strong>Learning Objectives</strong></p>

<p>At the completion of this course students will be able to demonstrate basic understanding of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>what is a robot, how are they being used and which applications can they have</li>
    <li>robot design, including electronics, software and mechatronics</li>
    <li>difficulties and obstacles to overcome when assembling a a technical project</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Attendance &amp; Participation</strong></p>

<p>Attendance in all class sessions is mandatory. Unexcused absences or lateness will adversely affect your grade. NYU policy does permit members of any religious group to absent themselves from classes without penalty when required for compliance with their religious obligations. If you are going to miss a class, it is your responsibility to make up the material you miss. Please let the instructor know ahead of time so that he/she can help you determine how to make up the material.</p>

<p>Your participation in this class is essential. Not only does it allow the instructor to gauge your interests and get to know you as an individual, but it also allows the instructor to asses your understanding of important concepts. It also provides the instructor with an opportunity to learn from your work. As a result, attendance and participation make up a meaningful percentage of your grade. Unexcused absence in more than three classes and / or labs will result in a failing grade.</p>
